简单说就是两个word之间的空白，一般包括连续的空格或tab（制表符），
特殊情况也包括换行回车。

> From Wikipedia:

In computer science, white space is any character or series of 
characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in 
typography. When rendered, a whitespace character does not 
correspond to a visible mark, but typically does occupy an area 
on a page. For example, the common whitespace symbol U+0020 
SPACE (HTML &#32;), also ASCII 32, represents a blank space 
punctuation character in text, used as a word divider in Western 
scripts.

The most common whitespace characters may be typed via the space 
bar or the tab key. Depending on context, a line-break generated 
by the return or enter key may be considered white space as well.
